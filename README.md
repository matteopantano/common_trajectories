## common_trajectories

This repository contains some of the more **common trajectories**. The title of each file should give you some ideas of what kind of trajectory could be generated.

## Installation

Download the .m file that is of your interest and then just open it as a script of matlab. In each file is explained how to use the parameters to get the wanted behavior.

## GUI
There is also a soimple GUI, just used for nicer visulization of the most common trajectories. The file is **GUI_working.m**, if you run it you also have the possibility to see the synchronization between two trajectories, giving a number of RPM of an eletric motor. So to use it, just open it, put a number on the field RPM and then execute, there is also the possibility to generate an EXCEL file inside the working directory that contains points of the trajectory for further use.
